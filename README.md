## Overview

## My process

- 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

-CSS can be very tricky, learning him is like a walk in the park on an dangerous neighborhood, it's cool but one fake step can cause chaos.

-Just abused from position
```
.ilustrationFaqDesktop{
    position: absolute;
    margin: -40% 0 0 -18%;
    width: 110%;
    z-index: 1;
}

.ilustrationDesktopImg{
    width: 100%;
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 1;
}

.ilustrationShadowFaqDesktop{
    position: relative;
    width: 100%;
    z-index: 0;
}

.ilustrationDesktopShadow{
    margin-top: -75%;
    margin-left: -100%;
    width: 200%;
    z-index: 0;
}

.ilustrationDesktopBox{
    position: absolute;
    z-index: 4;
    margin-left: -30%;
    margin-top: -10%;
    width: 45%;
}
```
-It was good to learn each function of fixed, absolute and relative.

### Continued development

- With future aknowledge I hope to find a better way to the ".sideGradient", at this point it looked fine but it can be better.
